        Usually, the front-end development is the final destination of visual
        design, a place where design "goes to".
      </p>

        <strong>from</strong> the development!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's one such idea. Move your cursor and follow these creatures, which
        are fundamentally nothing but simple SVG shapes replicated in all sorts
        of sequences, ending with a pair of eyes.
