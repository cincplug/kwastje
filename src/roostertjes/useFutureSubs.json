  "Will we ever be able to see the future?",
  "Yes, you are seeing the future right now!",
  "Not only seeing, you are controlling it!",
  "In which sense are you seeing the future?",
  "Well what you see in the background is text.",
  "And the text consists of only one word:",
  "Future",
  "And that word is then multiplied in many copies.",
  "And in which sense are you controlling the future?",
  "Well the text follows your mouse movement.",
  "Of course,",
  "You will object that you didn't really see that future,",
  "Because you saw only parts of letters.",
  "And you can say that you didn't control that future either,",
  "Because you don't understand how text follows your mouse.",
  "Well, that's how it is with the future.",
  "We usually don't see it because it's too close.",
  "And that's also why we think it's out of our hands:",
  "Because we don't understand how we affect it."
