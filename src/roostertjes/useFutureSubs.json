  "This little prototype shows you the future",
  "And it also lets you control the future",
  "How does it do it?",
  "You see that everything moving here is text",
  "And it consists of only one word: future",
  "With many variations, just like the future",
  "And how does this prototype let you control it?",
  "Well the text does follow your mouse movement",
  "Even if he logic how that happens is also unclear",
  "But that's also just like the future",
  "The point is, you see the future all the time",
  "But you usually stand too close to it",
  "And you don't understand how you affect it",
  "So you think you don't affect it",
  "Just because you zoom it too much",
  "Design and related crafts help you unzoom it",
  "You can proceed to the next installation",
  "But do tell everyone that you saw the future"
