  "This little prototype lets you control the future",
  "How does it do it?",
  "Well, everything that's moving here is just text",
  "The text consists of only one word: future",
  "The word moves around in hardly explainable ways",
  "But all those ways do follow your mouse movement",
  "And that's the point about the future",
  "You see the future all the time",
  "But you usually stand too close to it",
  "So you think you don't see it",
  "And you don't understand how you affect it",
  "So you think that you don't affect it either",
  "And in reality, you just zoomed it too much",
  "Design and related crafts can help you with that", 
  "They can tell you where to move your mouse",
  "And to help you to unzoom your future"
