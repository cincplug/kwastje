  "Do you see your future?",
  "If you don't, try moving your mouse around",
  "At some position, you will see the future",
  "And by that we merely mean the word 'future'",
  "But symbolically we also mean your actual future",
  "Because that's how it usually is:",
  "You actually see your future all the time",
  "But you stand too close to it",
  "So you think you don't see it",
  "And since you don't see how you affect it",
  "You think you don't affect it either",
  "And in reality, it's often just too zoomed",
  "That's what we do in design and related crafts", 
  "We help you to un-zoom your future",
  "By advising you where to move your mouse."
